<h1 align="center">Murife Online Shopping Community</h1>


This is the backend for the Murife online shopping community app where our API exists. <br/>
``Murife shopping`` website is used to help customers make the right choice when it comes to purchasing products online. The site gives the user an avenue to search for a product, compare the product's cost and marginal benefits based on prices, ratings, mode of payment etc, and decide which product they want and from which online shop.
